# NAIC-Earendel
Dessert Recognition AI for competition

To train the AI, make sure your Python is in 3.9 - 3.11 for TensorFlow compatibility 
Use the code in the command prompt to check your Python version 
```
python-- version
```

Then make sure you have downloaded all the libraries needed
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

In line 10 in the train code
Change the directory to the file with the train data
Make sure the folder structure is in the form below 
```
Datafile
|--cookie
| |--cookie1.png
| |-- ....
|--Cake
| |--cake1.png
| |-- ...
|-- ....
```

To execute 
```
py your code location
```

To test your file 
Prepare some data in a folder and change the directory in the test code 
Make sure the array in the test file has all the types of dessert and is in the same order as the file of data
Execute the code 

Check the result
